## hollywood-actors-network

The subject of the project is the analysis of the network of the most sought-after Hollywood actors in 2018. 
The goal of the project is to discover regularities in the mutual cooperation of actors, 
including finding appropriate centers (centroids) that would group a certain "type" of actor, as well as predicting future cooperation.
